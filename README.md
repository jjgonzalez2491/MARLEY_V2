# MARLEY V2: EU-ETS under attack? The impact of carbon price suppression on the decarbonization of the power sector

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of the **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Long-term Electricity Markets (MARLEY)** framework for modeling long-term electricity markets, used in the article "Assessing Long Term Electricity Market Design for Ambitious Decarbonization Targets using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning". The model enables the assessment of various market designs, policy instruments, and decarbonization strategies in electricity systems, with a focus on capturing the adaptive behavior of profit-maximizing generation companies making investment decisions.

The framework employs **Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO)** to simulate decentralized, competitive market environments where multiple agents invest in generation assets through wholesale markets, capacity remuneration mechanisms, and Contract for Differences (CfD) auctions. The framework is based on the Ray and RLLIB MARL implementations, available in https://github.com/ray-project.

## Installation

### Main Requirements

- Python 3.9
- Conda or Miniconda
- Recommended Linux-based system

### Setup

1. **Clone this repository:**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jjgonzalez2491/MARLEY_V1.git
   cd MARLEY_V1
```

2. **Create and activate the conda environment:**
```bash
   conda env create -f ray_environment.yml
   conda activate ray_environment
```

3. **Adjust the corresponding directories**

4. **Modify the training script and the base excel files to set up the simulation**

## Usage

### Training

To train agents in the electricity market environment:
```bash
python training_CM_CfD.py
```
To configure the scenario, it is necessary to modify the corresponding variables in the training script and in the corresponding excel file. 

> **Note:** The training script is configured for HPC environments with LSF job scheduling. Modifications may be required for local execution (parallel environments for sampling, maximum GPU memory limits, among others). 

### Evaluation

To evaluate trained agents:
```bash
python data_CM_CfD.py
```
> **Note:** The evaluation script reads a RLLIB checkpoint obtained after training. For testing purposes, an exemplary checkpoint for a system with **16 agents** under **capacity market and CfD mechanisms** is provided in the `checkpoints/` folder.

### Data Files

Base Excel files containing market parameters, technology characteristics, and demand profiles are located in the `excel_scenario_files/` folder. These files define the stylized Italian electricity system used in the paper.

### Visualization

Plotting utilities are provided in the `utils/` folder for generating market outcome visualizations and performance metrics.
